		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		Welcome to JDramaStuff! My name is Maxence Delattre, I am a software engineer with a passion for foreign languages. 
		<br /><br />
		Originally, I developped a small software I called "LearnByDrama" to count and display word occurences by analyzing its Japanese subtitles.
		The idea is that I can filter words I already know in order to find the most used words I don't know yet, and focus on learning these words. 
		By doing this, I avoid spending time on learning words which are almost never used.
		
		<br /><br />
		The software is written in Java, uses Kuromoji as tokenizer, and well, it works but doesn't look very modern:

		<br /><br />
		I wanted to share this program eventually, but nowadays it's all about web applications, python libraries and sharing your stuff on github, and so here we are!
		<br />
		Hopefully this resource will help you improve your japanese and let you enjoy japanese drama even more !
		<h2>Sources</h2>
		The sources of both the website and the python script to parse subtitles are available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/gramm/DramaCharCount">https://github.com/gramm/DramaCharCount</a>

		The subtitles were all gathered from the JPSubbers website, currently at <a href="http://jpsubbers.xyz/">http://jpsubbers.xyz/</a>
