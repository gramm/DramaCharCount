Welcome to the
<br />
<h3>Japanese Drama Proficiency Test (JDPT)</h3>
(just for fun)
<br />
<br />
</div>

<div class="blabla help text-left">
The JDPT is a collection of the most used kanji in Japanese drama sorted in 5 levels like in JLPT lists you find on the web. 
<br />
It's a list I made for fun, 
although it is quite interesting to see what words are much more common in dramas as in the everyday Japanese taught in the JLPT.

<br />
The number of kanji per level is as follow:

<br />
<table class="table table-sm">
<tr><td>JDPT 5:</td><td>79 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 4:</td><td>166 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 3:</td><td>367 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 2:</td><td>367 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 1:</td><td>1222 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total :</td><td>2201 kanji</td></tr>
</table>
