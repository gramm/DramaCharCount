Welcome to the
<br />
<h3>Japanese Drama Proficiency Test (JDPT)</h3>
(just for fun)
<br />
<br />
</div>

<div class="blabla help text-left">
The JDPT is a collection of the most used kanji in Japanese drama subtitle files, sorted in 6 levels to imitate the JLPT and other vocabulary lists you find on the web. 
<br />
It's a list I made for fun, 
although it is quite interesting to see what words are the most common in dramas compared to other corpus such as newspaper or the Japanese Wikipedia.

<br />
The kanji are assigned to one of 6 JDPT levels according to the cumulative frequency of the kanji. 
For example, all JDPT 5 kanji together represent 50% of all kanji used accross all dramas while all JDPT 5 and 4 together represent 75% of all kanji used.
The exact repartition is as follows:
</div>
<br />
<table class="table table-sm text-left"><tr>
<tr><th>Level</th><th>Cumulative frequency</th><th>Number of kanji in this level</th></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 5:</td><td>50%</td><td>143 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 4:</td><td>75%</td><td>281 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 3:</td><td>90%</td><td>435 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 2:</td><td>95%</td><td>323 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 1:</td><td>98%</td><td>391 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT 0:</td><td>99%</td><td>266 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of JDPT kanji:</td><td></td><td>1839 kanji</td></tr>
<tr><td>Not in JDPT:</td><td>100%</td><td>2173 kanji</td></tr>

For each kanji, the following information is displayed:<br />
</div>

<table class="table table-sm text-left"><tr>
<tr><td>Kanji</td><td>The kanji itself :o)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Count</td><td>The number of occurrences between all subtitle files.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frequency</td><td>The occurrence frequency i.e. count for this kanji divided by the total kanji count (which does not include hiragana for example).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cumulated Frequency</td><td>The cumulative frequency. For example a value of 50% means that the number of occurrences of all kanji up to the current kanji represent 50% of every kanji in every dramas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Drama Frequency</td><td>The frequency of appearance of this kanji across dramas. For example a value of 30% means that this kanji appears in 30% of all dramas (and never appears once in the other 70% of dramas).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Episode Frequency</td><td>The frequency of appearance of this kanji across episodes. For example a value of 30% means that this kanji appears in 30% of all episodes (and never appears once in the other 70% of episodes).</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT</td><td>The JDPT level for this kanji. The JDPT is defined using the cumulative frequency as follows:</td></tr>
<tr><td>JDPT Pos</td><td>The JDPT position i.e. the position when sorted by JDPT level then by count within each level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jōyō</td><td>The Jōyō level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jōyō Pos</td><td>The Jōyō position i.e. the position when sorted by Jōyō level then by count within each level.</td></tr>
