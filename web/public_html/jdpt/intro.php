Welcome to the
<br />
<h3>Japanese Drama Proficiency Test (JDPT)</h3>
<br />

The JDPT is a collection of the most used kanji in Japanese drama sorted in 5 levels like in JLPT lists you find on the web. 
<br />
It's a list I made for fun, 
although it is quite interesting to see what words are much more common in dramas as in the everyday Japanese taught in the JLPT.
